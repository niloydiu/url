# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

Quick local setup:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `VITE_API_BASE` to your backend, e.g. `http://localhost:8000`.
2. Run `npm install` and `npm run dev`.

The app uses `VITE_API_BASE` to locate the backend API (defaults to `http://localhost:8000`).
